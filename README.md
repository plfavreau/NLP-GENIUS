# NLP-GENIUS ðŸŽµ âœ¨

NLP-GENIUS is a cutting-edge natural language processing project that combines the power of transformers and machine learning to create an innovative music technology suite. It features:

### ðŸŽ¹ Title to Lyrics Generator (Transformer)
Transform any title into complete song lyrics using a fine-tuned GPT-2 model trained on over 1M songs. The model captures musical patterns and lyrical structures to generate coherent and creative lyrics that match the input title's theme.

### ðŸŽ¯ Genre Classifier
An advanced machine learning classifier that can predict a song's genre based on its lyrics. Using a combination of logistic regression and naive Bayes algorithms, it achieves impressive accuracy in categorizing songs into different musical styles.

### ðŸ”¬ Key Technical Features
- Fine-tuned GPT-2 transformer model for lyric generation
- Sophisticated text preprocessing pipeline
- Multi-model ensemble classification
- Docker containerization for easy deployment
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics and benchmarking

## Title to Lyrics Transformer

### Getting the weights

#### Use the pre-computed weights

- A long training has already been made over 1M lyrics (RTX 4090 for 18 hours) :
- Download the weights [here](https://pilou.org/NLP/trained_model.zip).
- Extract the archive in the transformer directory. Your file tree should look like this :

```bash
/NLP-GENIUS$ tree -L 2
.
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ dataset
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ song_lyrics.csv
 ...

â””â”€â”€ transformers
    â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
    â”œâ”€â”€ __pycache__
    â”œâ”€â”€ classes.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ preprocessing.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
    â”œâ”€â”€ title_to_lyrics_transformer.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ trained_model # <- Extracted archive
    â””â”€â”€ training.py
```

#### .. Or train from scratch

Configure a .env file in the transformer directory. The following config will train the model for 10 epochs over 1000 rows :

```bash
# /NLP_GENIUS/transformers/.env
TSF_TRAINING=True
TSF_EPOCHS=10
TSF_ROWS=1000
```

Then install the dependencies and run the python script :

```bash
/NLP-GENIUS/transformers$ pip install -r requirements.txt
/NLP-GENIUS/transformers$ python title_to_lyrics_transformer.py
```

### Generating lyrics

#### Build the Docker image

Make sure to be at the root of the project.
First image build will take some time (copying the whole dataset) ~ 12mn.

```bash
 pwd # /NLP-GENIUS

 docker build -t nlp_transformer -f transformers/Dockerfile .
```

#### Run the Docker container

```bash
docker run -e TSF_TITLE="Hello darkness" -it nlp_transformer
```
